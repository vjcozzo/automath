# automath
a set of algorithms that solve problems in number theory

## Programs so Far
*   chinese-remainder-theorem.c -- uses the chinese remander theorem to compute a solution to many modular congruences. (Note: a precondition, for now at least, is that the moduli of different congruences are pairwise coprime, or else the program is not guaranteed to succeed).
*   find-order.c -- computes the order of a given natural number modulo a larger number.
